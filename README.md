Noon
The time when the sun is at its highest point directly above the observer.

Midnight
The time when the sun is at its lowest point.

Sunset
The time in the evening when the sun is about to disappear below the horizon (asuming a location with no obscuring features.)

Dusk
The time in the evening when the sun is a specific number of degrees below the horizon.

Daylight
The time when the sun is up i.e. between sunrise and sunset

Night
